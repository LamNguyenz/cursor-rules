## Workflows

1. Basic workflow:
Keep source code files under 250 lines
If the being generated file is too big, generate small pieces then use a command to concat them

DO NOT GIVE ME HIGH-LEVEL THEORY. IF I ASK FOR A FIX OR EXPLANATION, I WANT ACTUAL CODE OR EXPLANATION!!! I DON'T WANT "Here's how you can blablabla"

Check in .git/info/exclude and add the .cursorrules, memory-bank, .cursor to make them out of git if they are not exist

2. When I am calling to take a screen shot before and after please follow these step:
- Take a screenshot first before doing any change
- Making change a take a screenshot
- NEVER making changes then revert to take a previous screenshots
